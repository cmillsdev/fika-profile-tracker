Quest/Hideout Progress Bars: 
Visual indicators showing completion % for each quest/hideout module, with nested requirements (e.g., "Find 5/10 Gas Analyzers").

Trader Reputation Dashboard: Track loyalty levels, required spend thresholds, and locked items/quests.

Dynamic Task/Hideout Checklists: Highlight FiR items needed for active quests or hideout upgrades (e.g., "You need 3 more Corrugated Hoses").

Gear Presets: Pre-configure loadouts for specific quests/maps (e.g., "Shoreline – Sanitar Kill – Loadout: Mosin, CMS, SJ6").

Crafting Profit Calculator: Compare craft costs (materials) vs. flea market sale prices to identify profitable crafts.

"Next Raid" Recommendations: Suggest quests/maps to prioritize based on progress (e.g., "You’re 2 kills away from completing Punisher – Queue for Shoreline").

Shared Progression: Allow friends/teammates to sync quest progress (e.g., "We both need to kill Reshala – Queue together").

Track each other’s active quests/hideout upgrades (e.g., “Alex needs 2 more fuel cans for Generator 3”).

Stats like “Most Headshots,” “Longest Survival Streak,” or “Most Modded Boss Kills.”

Log accidental teamkills (with a shame counter 😂).

Monitor API uptime, server latency, or mod version mismatches.

Quick Restock Alerts:“Your group has 2 Surv12 kits left – craft more!”

RNGesus Altar:A button that “blesses” your next raid with fake RNG luck (purely placebo, but fun).

AI-generated Raid Stories: Use a simple LLM to turn raid stats into absurd narratives (e.g., “Alex fought a pack of MODDED CYBERSCAVS and lived… barely”).   

Meme Loadout Generator: A button that auto-equips the weirdest possible gear combo (e.g., "Altyn + Hawaiian shirt + double-barrel shotgun").

Loadout Roulette: Generate a random loadout from your stash (weapons, armor, meds). Forces you to use gear you never touch.

"PMC Horoscope": Generate funny daily predictions based on stats: "Your survival rate says… avoid Shoreline. Also, hydrate."

Survival Bingo: Pre-raid bingo cards with challenges like: "Loot 3 GPUs" | "Die to a Scav with a TOZ" | "Extract with 0.1 health."

"Skill Issue" Calculator: Compare your stats to friends: "Alex’s survival rate is 12%… but he has 300% more grenade kills than you. 🤔"

Hideout Craft/Bitcoin Farm Timers: Countdowns for active crafts (e.g., "5m until bullets done"). Bitcoin farm efficiency (profit per hour, time to next coin).

Stash Value Snapshot: Total stash value (roubles/items) + most valuable single item. Flea listings expiring soon (e.g., "Your GPU listing ends in 20m").

Flea Arbitrage Alerts: Highlight items in your stash that are selling for 20%+ more on flea than trader buy price.
